    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These baked Greek-style chicken pops are a different way to serve chicken legs. Marinated with Greek yogurt,
        lemon, garlic, and Greek seasoning, these tasty chicken “lollipops” work as an appetizer, or a main dish. For a
        main dish, allow 2 pops per serving.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Greek seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>8 skin-on, bone-in chicken legs</li>
        <li>fresh parsley, cherry tomatoes, and Kalamata olives for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, Greek seasoning, and garlic in a large resealable
            bag. Season with salt and pepper (see Note). Gently squeeze the ingredients inside the bag to mix.</li>
        <li>For each chicken leg, hold the bony tip with one hand and run a knife around the bone, just below the meaty
            part, cutting all the way to the bone. Use kitchen shears to sever the tendon, if necessary, and remove any
            exposed tendon.</li>
        <li>With the knife, push the meat down toward the meaty joint, being careful to avoid the slender secondary
            bone. Cut away as much as possible of the secondary bone.</li>
        <li>Again, push the meat down toward the meaty joint, forming a little ball. Remove skin and cartilage from the
            bony tip and remove any tissue with a knife or with kitchen shears.</li>
        <li>Place chicken pops inside the bag with the marinade. Seal the bag, with as little air inside the bag as
            possible. Gently squeeze chicken pops and marinade until pops are well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator
            for at least 3 hours, or up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and line a baking pan with foil.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken pops from marinade. Reform the meaty ball, and wrap bony ends with a small piece of foil (see
            Note). Place on the prepared pan in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn on the broiler, and set a rack 6 inches from the heat source.</li>
        <li>Broil until brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant read thermometer, inserted near the center, should
            read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cool in the pan 2 to 3 minutes, then place on a serving plate. Garnish with parsley sprigs, cherry tomatoes,
            and Kalamata olives, if desired</li>
    </ol>
